# Grade Portal 

This Grade Portal implements Java, SQL, File IO, Thread Concurrency, and SQL/JDBC. 
I used Netbeans and MySQL Workbench

It is a student grade portal that supports both student and professor log-ins. If a student logs in,
it will show them their grades. If a professor logs in, it will open the portal where they can view
all student data, edit student grades, search for specific students, or see current class statistics.
